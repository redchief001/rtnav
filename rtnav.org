* rtnav.el - A todo list generator and quick source tree navigator
** Description
*** Basic requirements and functions [28%]
    - [ ] Parse a directory tree recursively searching for annotations
      (like TODO, NOTE, XXXX, and FIXME in comments) in each source code file
      in the working tree.
    - [ ] Compile the annotations, line numbers, and associated file names
      in a buffer that gets displayed to the user.
    - [ ] The items extracted from the task list item should include a file
      name and a line number (integer) along with the annotation itself.
    - [ ] The list entry are used to open the associated file in its own window
      with the point at the line number indicated.
    - [ ] Process is repeated as long as the buffer is live
    - [X] Enable the user to parse a task list item with a command and key
      binding.
    - [X] Display the generated task list file in a new window.

** Tasks
*** To do list [50%]
    - [ ] Finish coding the library.
    - [ ] Rename the library file and/or consolidate it with the mode source
      file.
    - [ ] Finish the test cases necessary to have basic functionality.
    - [ ] Add the completed functions to the minor mode
    - [X] Consider organic list generation with lisp -- we are doing this shit!
    - [X] Factor out some test scaffolding in the form of test fixtures.
    - [X] Figure out how to use a temp buffer for testing.
    - [X] Create a library file to stage functions (right now they are in the
      rtlib.el file)
